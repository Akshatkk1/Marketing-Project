# Marketing Analytics

#About the project:

##Understanding customer behaviour: By analyzing data, I would like to learn customer’s preferences and buying habits. It would be imperative in finding valuable customers and also their purchasing patterns. 

##Better marketing strategies: Customer and product segmentation would be helpful for me in developing appropriate marketing strategies. This would lead the business in more efficiently reaching its key segments in the customer segments and also in building utilization of marketing resources. 

##Identifying essential products: I will look more into the products generating better sales and realize more profit; through this, the company will then focus all its resources on popularizing such products. 

##Sales Trend Analysis: I would wish to know whether there is any seasonal or monthly trend in sales so that I can use that information to do promotional strategies. By noting when peaks happen, the company can time its marketing efforts for better impact.
